# Mimicry App

## Description
This Mimicry App is a project inspired by the GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) OUI (Orientation to University and Internship) event for freshers. Originally, the app showcased speech-to-text recognition. Building upon this concept, I expanded its functionality to include text-to-speech mimicry.

The app utilizes Vanilla JavaScript for its core functionality, making it lightweight and easy to understand. It allows users to speak into their device's microphone, converts their speech to text, and then converts that text back into speech, effectively mimicking the user's input.

## Features
- Speech-to-text recognition
- Text-to-speech mimicry
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/devhabeeblateef/mimicJavascript.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
1. Allow the app to access your device's microphone.
2. Click the microphone button to start speaking.
3. Once you finish speaking, the app will convert your speech to text.
4. The text will then be converted back into speech, mimicking your input.
5. Enjoy experimenting with the app's mimicry capabilities!

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the app or fix any issues, please follow these steps:
